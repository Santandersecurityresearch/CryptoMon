# Security Policy

We like bugs. We aim to make our code as robust and secure as possible and throw the kitchen at it, but bugs happen and we'd be so happy if you'd tell us about one, or two, you might have found.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Easiest way is to create an issue. We monitor this and believe in full transparency and will do our best to fix it as quickly as possible. We also love PR's too ;)
